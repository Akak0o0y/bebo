/**
 * Bot silhouettes — all OpenAgents originals.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. The Aora engine ships three character
 * silhouettes (blob, wedge, gem) whose licence makes them permanently
 * non-commercial: unlike the engine and the emotion data, no commercial licence
 * is offered for them and none ever will be. Editing them would not help — a
 * modified silhouette is a derivative work and inherits the same restriction.
 *
 * So none of them are used. Every shape below is generated here from a formula:
 * a superellipse, a stadium, a rounded polygon, a union of disks, the classic
 * teardrop curve. Those are mathematical primitives, not anyone's artwork, so the results
 * are independent creations carrying no third-party terms. `registerShapes()`
 * writes them into the engine's shape table, which ships empty.
 *
 * What REMAINS Aora's is the expression engine and the emotion data — the state
 * machine, spring interpolation, eye rings, keyframes. That is a different
 * licence class: free for non-commercial use and commercially licensable. See
 * THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md.
 *
 * The engine consumes a shape as a closed 100-point polygon in its coordinate
 * system (viewBox -15 -15 259 259, centre 114.2705) plus a face fit. Defining
 * each as an "is this point inside" predicate and sampling it keeps the
 * definition readable and tunable by one number instead of 600 decimals.
